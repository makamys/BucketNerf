# BucketNerf
This is a mod that makes buckets worse in the following ways:
* When using a water bucket, it will turn into an empty bucket without placing a water block
* A random cooldown is added after milking a Tameable Arachne mob

All features can be disabled and customized in the config. The config is reloaded when the world is reloaded, or when the `/bucketnerf reload` chat command is invoked.
